<b>JWTJuggernaut</b>

A work in progress.

I hope to create a tool that can serve as a Swiss Army Knife for testing JWT implementations, with a focus on automating attacks and being highly configurable. I primarily use [Ticarpi's jwt_tool](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool/tree/master) and Burp Suite's [JWT Editor plugin](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/26aaa5ded2f74beea19e2ed8345a93dd) when testing JWTs, and with this tool I hope to combine features from both into a single do-it-all tool. A main feature that I plan to implement that I would find useful in my own testing is the ability to pass the tool an HTTP request in a txt file, which is easily one of my favorite features of SQLMap. My initial goals for this tool are to implement functionality to solve all of the [BurpSuite Practitioner JWT labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt) with as little user interaction as possible, automating attack steps wherever I can.

In the future, I hope to find a way to implement and automate the functionality of [silentsignal's rsa2sign jwt_forgery.py](https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n) to attempt to calculate the RSA signing keys of a JWT pair. Additionally, I'd like to start researching OAuth2 authentication flows (and potentially other JWT-based mechanisms using access and refresh tokens) and hope to eventually add additional capabilities to JWTJuggernaut for testing such implementations.
